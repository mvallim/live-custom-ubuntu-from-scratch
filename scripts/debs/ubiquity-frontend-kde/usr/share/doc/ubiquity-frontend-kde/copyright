Ubiquity was formerly known as "Espresso", and originally as "Ubuntu
Express", which is written and maintained by Javier Carranza
<javier.carranza@interactors.coop> and Juanje Ojeda Croissier
<juanje@interactors.coop>. This version draws on the work done on Ubuntu
Express, but was renamed to avoid confusion, to reduce awkward branding
considerations, and because Ubiquity concentrates on reusing
debian-installer code and reducing duplicated translation and branding work
as much as possible. Ubiquity has now substantially diverged from Ubuntu
Express and is an independent project.

Ubiquity has been adapted for usage by the Mythbuntu
team for the purposes of a Ubuntu derivative focused
upon setting up a standalone MythTV box.
